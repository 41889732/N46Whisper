# N46Whisper

Language : English | [简体中文](./README_CN.md) 

N46Whisper is a Google Colab notebook application that created for streamlined video subtitle file generation to improve productivity of Nogizaka46 (and Sakamichi groups) subbers.

The notebook is based on [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper), a general-prupose speech recognition model.

The output file will be in .ass format with built-in style of selected sub group so it can be directly imported into [Aegisub](https://github.com/Aegisub/Aegisub) for subsequent editing.

## How to use
* [Click here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Ayanaminn/N46Whisper/blob/main/N46Whisper.ipynb) to open the notebook in Google Colab.
* Upload file and follow the instruction to run the notebook.
* The ass file will be automatically downloaded once done.
