# N46Whisper

N46Whisper is a Google Colab notebook application that created for streamedlined video subtitle file generation to improve productivity of Nogizaka46 (and Sakamichi groups) subbers.

The notebook is based on [Whisper](https://https://github.com/openai/whisper), a general-prupose speech recognition model.

The output file will be in .ass format with built-in style of selected sub group so it can be directly imported into [Aegisub](https://github.com/Aegisub/Aegisub) for subsequent editing.
